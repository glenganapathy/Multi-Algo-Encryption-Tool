                    <h2>About Cybersecurity</h2>
                    <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.</p>
                    <p>Effective cybersecurity requires multiple layers of protection spread across computers, networks, and data. In an organization, the people, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective defense from cyber attacks.</p>
                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring that data is accessed only by authorized individuals. Encryption is a key tool for maintaining confidentiality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data over its entire lifecycle.</li>
                        <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring that information is available when needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This application demonstrates basic cryptographic algorithms that form the building blocks of modern cybersecurity systems.</p>
