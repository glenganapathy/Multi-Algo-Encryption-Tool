                    <h3>Caesar Cipher</h3>
                    <p>The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Monoalphabetic Cipher</h3>
                    <p>A monoalphabetic substitution cipher is a substitution cipher in which for a given key, the cipher alphabet for each plain alphabet is fixed throughout the encryption process. For example, if 'A' is encrypted to 'Q', every time we see an 'A' in the plaintext, it will be encrypted to a 'Q'.</p>

                    <h3>Playfair Cipher</h3>
                    <p>The Playfair cipher was the first practical digraph substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but bears the name of Lord Playfair who promoted its use. It encrypts pairs of letters (digraphs), instead of single letters as in the simple substitution cipher.</p>

                    <h3>Hill Cipher</h3>
                    <p>The Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra. Invented by Lester S. Hill in 1929, it was the first polygraphic cipher in which it was practical (though barely) to operate on more than three symbols at once.</p>

                    <h3>Vigenère Cipher</h3>
                    <p>The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It is a form of polyalphabetic substitution.</p>

                    <h3>One-Time Pad (OTP)</h3>
                    <p>The one-time pad is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a one-time pre-shared key that is not smaller than the message being sent. In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (or pad).</p>

                    <h3>Columnar Transposition Cipher</h3>
                    <p>The columnar transposition cipher is a form of transposition cipher. It involves writing the plaintext out in rows of a fixed length, and then reading the ciphertext out column by column. The columns are read in an order determined by a keyword.</p>
